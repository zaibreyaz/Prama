 The diagram shows the relationship between the total cost of inventory and the quantity of inventory ordered. The total cost is the sum of the ordering cost and the holding cost. The ordering cost is the cost of placing an order, and the holding cost is the cost of holding inventory.

The optimal order quantity is the point where the total cost is minimized. This is the point where the ordering cost and the holding cost are equal.

The diagram shows that the total cost curve is a U-shaped curve. The curve is initially concave, meaning that the marginal cost of ordering is decreasing. This is because the cost of ordering a large quantity of inventory is less than the cost of ordering a small quantity of inventory. However, as the quantity of inventory ordered increases, the marginal cost of ordering begins to increase. This is because the cost of holding inventory increases as the quantity of inventory increases.

The optimal order quantity is the point where the marginal cost of ordering is equal to the marginal cost of holding. This is the point where the total cost is minimized.
