 The diagram shows the relationship between the annual cost of holding inventory and the annual cost of ordering inventory. The total cost is the sum of the holding cost and the ordering cost. The EOQ is the order quantity that minimizes the total cost.

The holding cost is the cost of storing inventory. This cost includes the cost of capital, the cost of insurance, and the cost of storage space. The holding cost increases as the order quantity increases.

The ordering cost is the cost of placing an order. This cost includes the cost of processing the order, the cost of shipping the order, and the cost of receiving the order. The ordering cost decreases as the order quantity increases.

The total cost is the sum of the holding cost and the ordering cost. The total cost is minimized at the EOQ.

The EOQ is the order quantity that minimizes the total cost. The EOQ is calculated using the following formula:

EOQ =
